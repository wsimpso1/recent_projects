Does country income level have an impact on when countries begin making payments on their IBRD loans? An analysis of historical data.

The source for the main dataset used in this project can be found here: https://finances.worldbank.org/Loans-and-Credits/IBRD-Statement-Of-Loans-Historical-Data/zucq-nrc3.

The World Bank has two main branches that provide loans to countries for development: the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA). This dataset enumerates IBRD loan data only since 1947.

Access is free and open to the public and does not violate any laws. A preliminary google search shows that there are some analyses on World Bank loan trends, but this analysis focuses on countries' loan repayment behavior. Specifically, I focus on how income level of countries impacts the speed of loan repayment?

My background in economics provides me with knowledge to analyze this data and I hypothesize that high income countries make their first loan repayment sooner than middle or low income countries.

The dataset is made up of 1,005,407 rows and 33 columns and is approximately 369MB.

Supplemental data on GNI and income level can be found here: https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/stories/the-classification-of-countries-by-income.html.
