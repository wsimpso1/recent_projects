## Project Description
This project leverages transfer learning to retrain an object detection model to identify 5 classes of vehicles in satellite and aerial imagery
1) Small vehicles
2) Large vehicles
3) Ships
4) Planes
5) Helicopters

This retrained model is meant to assist in the automatic identification of Russian military vehicles in light of Russia's February invasion of Ukraine.\
Note: Due to computation limitations that impacted training, this version of the model achieves an accuracy of approximately 20%. However, despite this, instances of all classes were successfully identified by the model. Future iterations of this project will test alternative models and supplement the training images to improve performance.
