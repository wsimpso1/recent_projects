## Abstract:
As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, its long-term impact remains unclear. We investigate the potential long-term impacts of COVID-19 on the spatial distribution of crime in Washington, D.C. through an analysis of machine learning classification models’ ability to classify D.C. crimes by ward. We compare the performances on this classification task (measured by accuracy) for two sets of models— one model trained on pre-pandemic crime data (2017-March 2020) and the other on crimes reported during the pandemic (March 2020-October 2021). Cross tests of model performance on data augmented with COVID-19 statistics reveal no statistically significant differences in accuracy. Derived features measuring the distance of crimes to metro stations, nightclubs, and places of worship were shown to be key factors in model accuracy. Finally, we demonstrated that COVID-19 specific features (D.C. daily cases, daily deaths, and the number of police officers unable to work for COVID-19-related reasons) had little impact on model performance. Overall, we conclude that similar crime models based on data prior to the pandemic should still be valid today, and future researchers can safely consider pandemic era crime data in such models without substantive modifications.
