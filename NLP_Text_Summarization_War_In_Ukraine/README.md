## Project Description
Utilizing automatic text summarization, this project presents a web-based analysis tool (Streamlit) that is designed to alleviate the difficulty of filtering through the immense volume of data about the war in Ukraine to keep track of major developments. Based on existing research on event summarization, we explore the capabilities of named entity recognition (NER), topic modeling, clustering, and sentiment analysis methods to help identify important sub-events for automatic summarization. Compared to a timeline of actual events, we find that our primarily unsupervised summarization system successfully identified important sub-events within the war in Ukraine.

## Recorded Presentation
We present the Streamlit application we designed for this project, prefaced with a short "movie trailer" I made to set the stage for our analysis.
