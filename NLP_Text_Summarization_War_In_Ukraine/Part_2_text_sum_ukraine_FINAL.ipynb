              "0       The US want Russia in Ukraine so they can fight them in a proxy war. They will supply Ukraine equipment maybe thru other nations and watch Russia get stuck into a grind similar to Vietnam or Afghanistan. A serious war like that will shatter the Russian military..  After the cold war the USA made guarantees to Russia that NATO wouldn’t expand to Eastern Europe.  Can’t blame Russia for drawing a line at Ukraine.. Was glaubst Du, was in den ganzen Weihnachtspäckchen aus Polen, der Ukraine, Bulgarien etc war?\\nDa können wir schon froh sein, dass UPS, DPD und die anderen nicht in die Luft geflogen sind.. nato really wants to lure russia to war with ukraine, nato should stop provoking, russia won't attack first.. If Putin moves in Ukraine he wins but at a cost to Russia future. Ukraine will fight into a quagmire and Russia doesn’t have the youth population to replace their army after a bloody Vietnam Afghanistan type war..            Look forward to seeing you propagandists end up in the docket in The Hague on war crimes charges.. I didn't know that the term \"European Theater\" was still in use lol\\n\\nI mean there's the Ukraine - Russia war, but still....Happy New Year's! Ukraine!!

He had already declared war on the US!!.print from a negative. This author had encountered this unforgettable picture in an early 1920s publication of a Russian famine of the period following World War I. In any event, it will be recalled that Walker was never in Ukraine in 1932-1933.\".RT : When the clocks strike midnight this evening, it will mark a new year — and for Ukraine, the beginning of a ninth straight calendar year at war.\\n\\nStory by .\\n  The reason ruSSia is doing whatever they're doing is not to let NATO accept Ukraine. ruSSia is afraid of the USA ; will never win the war against the USA.\\nThey need to stop painting grass green before even dreaming of being close to the power of the USA.

If you support the Kremlin in its war against Ukraine - you support imperialism and as such British imperialism in Ireland..Biden vows US to act decisively if Russia invades Ukraine \\nWhat's the meaning of Biden's statement the US to act decisively if Russia invade Ukraine? Hopefully Biden isn't going to get us into a nuclear war with Russia because of Ukraine or anyone else other than our own security.@RepLeeZeldin @LizMacDonaldFOX @FoxBusiness Actually, #DecentAmericans are fully behind @POTUS drawing a red line when it comes to Putin, @leezeldin\\n\\nWe know they they have been waging a stealth war against US (with your super willing help, #Treasonweasel) &amp; a real one against Ukraine\\n\\nWe owe them for standing up to TFG.@lsutigerzfan @AP They're not going to war over Ukraine.@FaceTheNation @margbrennan @RepAdamSchiff Hopefully \"We The People\" see through this war spin, the deception, and not hand them our vote. Russian collusion, Ukraine quid pro quo, now Ukraine invasion, on, and on..Never underestimate the stupidity of the human race. With a weak &amp; demented @POTUS a coordinated Russian invasion of Ukraine &amp; a Chinese invasion of Taiwan can easily happen. War is always a pretext for economic resets. Russia holds more gold than $  That is very telling https://t.co/Mxfy1duK4q.Decisively… explain that Mr. Biden.\\nDraw us a picture.  You tired of not having troops in a war?  There is no stomach in America for anything like a war.  But…. it would be good for business.\\nSorry Ukraine, either way you get trounced. https://t.co/XJK86AILU9.@ABC Putin will not invade Ukraine but to stifle it, creating a tense atmosphere for a considerable long duration. Biden will not risk a nuclear war over Ukraine and Taiwan. Russia and China know it and they lift a finger when they feel like it . Biden cannot afford another blunder..@AngusEverist @gastweet @StephenKing Ukraine and russia are literally on the brink of war..To simplify: Biden is pushing Ukraine into a war with Russia.\\nInflation is a sure sign of incompetent government.\\nTo confirm his incompetence, war seems logical. \\nComedian is supposed to provoke Russian military response. Not a joke but hey. \\nAmerican hegemony in full display! https://t.co/yxeXczx5RW.#NATO #Russia #Putin #EiropeanUnion #China \\n#UnitedStates #Ukraine \\nIn fact, Russia is afraid of war and is bluffing to achieve its goals through intimidation. However, she may face severe punishment. Moscow and St. Petersburg will be destroyed and China will win over Siberia..@2012templar @Biz_Ukraine_Mag No.\\nLook, you look at the Russo-Ukrainian war as a normal person. It's the problem of the most people who try to understand 'what Putin wants'. In order to understand Putin and his plans you need to start to think as a psychopath.\\nMaybe this'll help\\nhttps://t.co/TWiwRcjVz3.Eastern European game devs are so hilariously odd. Their studio will be in some depressing soviet era flat near the artic. And every game is like “imagine the Ukraine war… but with alien relics that transform animals into monsters… plus radiation” https://t.co/3DG5AvhFyM.@TarasKuzio Bandera was a murderer and war criminal. Responsible for the slaughter of Polish civilians in Volhynia. Ukrainians, worshiping Bandera, spit in the face of Poles, and this is the only one nation that supports a free Ukraine..@BBCNews Ukraine is one the verge of war. They really shouldn't waste their time on little things like this. Embarrassing.@Oenbennach @DAlperovitch @McFaul Indeed. Looking at the map, only Ukraine won't be enough. But it's evident that this factor also helps explain why Russia is supporting an otherwise unloved Lukashenko in Belorussia. Putin and his Siloviki are stuck in 1980-ies cold war thinking when it comes to national threats..Letters to the Editor: Taiwan and Ukraine are underdogs, but is it wise to fight China and Russia? https://t.co/sR4FohHK7V via @Yahoo Most of that 50% isn't in the military and have no plans to join if we do go to war..Thousands march to honor WWII Nazi collaborator Ukraine is not a fledgling democracy just minding its own business.

But I've no idea how a military conflict between two separate countries can be designated so. Hello from Ukraine and good luck with your shorting..@ScottMoore0 @DanielCollins85 @bjhbfs @oconnellhugh Russia's response was not commensurate with the artificial coup in Kiev and the outbreak of the civil war in Ukraine. Russia's response will be proportionate only after the complete transfer of Kiev to Russian control..@NatashaBertrand US fuсkеd up territorial integrity principle with Kosovo (whose \"independence\" isn't recognized by Ukraine).

If you support the Kremlin in its war against Ukraine - you support imperialism and as such British imperialism in Ireland..Biden vows US to act decisively if Russia invades Ukraine \\nWhat's the meaning of Biden's statement the US to act decisively if Russia invade Ukraine? Hopefully Biden isn't going to get us into a nuclear war with Russia because of Ukraine or anyone else other than our own security.   Actually, DecentAmericans are fully behind  drawing a red line when it comes to Putin, \\n\\nWe know they they have been waging a stealth war against US (with your super willing help, Treasonweasel) ; a real one against Ukraine\\n\\nWe owe them for standing up to TFG.  They're not going to war over Ukraine.   Hopefully \"We The People\" see through this war spin, the deception, and not hand them our vote. Russian collusion, Ukraine quid pro quo, now Ukraine invasion, on, and on..Never underestimate the stupidity of the human race. With a weak ; demented  a coordinated Russian invasion of Ukraine ; a Chinese invasion of Taiwan can easily happen. War is always a pretext for economic resets. Russia holds more gold than $  That is very telling  explain that Mr. Biden.\\nDraw us a picture.  You tired of not having troops in a war?  There is no stomach in America for anything like a war.  But…. it would be good for business.\\nSorry Ukraine, either way you get trounced.  Putin will not invade Ukraine but to stifle it, creating a tense atmosphere for a considerable long duration. Biden will not risk a nuclear war over Ukraine and Taiwan. Russia and China know it and they lift a finger when they feel like it . Biden cannot afford another blunder..   Ukraine and russia are literally on the brink of war..To simplify: Biden is pushing Ukraine into a war with Russia.\\nInflation is a sure sign of incompetent government.\\nTo confirm his incompetence, war seems logical. \\nComedian is supposed to provoke Russian military response. Not a joke but hey. \\nAmerican hegemony in full display!  Russia Putin EiropeanUnion China \\nUnitedStates Ukraine \\nIn fact, Russia is afraid of war and is bluffing to achieve its goals through intimidation. However, she may face severe punishment. Moscow and St. Petersburg will be destroyed and China will win over Siberia..  No.\\nLook, you look at the Russo-Ukrainian war as a normal person. It's the problem of the most people who try to understand 'what Putin wants'. In order to understand Putin and his plans you need to start to think as a psychopath.\\nMaybe this'll help\\n European game devs are so hilariously odd. Their studio will be in some depressing soviet era flat near the artic. And every game is like “imagine the Ukraine war… but with alien relics that transform animals into monsters… plus radiation”  Bandera was a murderer and war criminal. Responsible for the slaughter of Polish civilians in Volhynia. Ukrainians, worshiping Bandera, spit in the face of Poles, and this is the only one nation that supports a free Ukraine.. Ukraine is one the verge of war. They really shouldn't waste their time on little things like this. Embarrassing.   Indeed. Looking at the map, only Ukraine won't be enough. But it's evident that this factor also helps explain why Russia is supporting an otherwise unloved Lukashenko in Belorussia. Putin and his Siloviki are stuck in 1980-ies cold war thinking when it comes to national threats..Letters to the Editor: Taiwan and Ukraine are underdogs, but is it wise to fight China and Russia?  via  Most of that 50% isn't in the military and have no plans to join if we do go to war..Thousands march to honor WWII Nazi collaborator Ukraine is not a fledgling democracy just minding its own business. Ukraine is being used by geopolitical forces in the West that answer to the bankrupt speculative financial system to trigger war with Russia   Adam Schiff says it appears to be 'very likely' that Russia will invade Ukraine Sanctions!! Let’s see how effective they are, North Korea, and Iran have Sanctions and they don’t really seem to care, why should Putin?  He thrived in the Cold War!  in America: 1/ Putin Ukraine threats 2/ Political Covid_19 plan 4 herd immunity \"lite\" 3/ No mandates bec 1/2 the US is anti science for economic reason 4/ Ignoring omicron impact on kids &lt;5 (horrific BTW) 5/ Jan6 redux possible 6/ talk of civil war 7/ TFG ; team r free. That \"civil war\" last since early 2014. But I've no idea how a military conflict between two separate countries can be designated so. Hello from Ukraine and good luck with your shorting..    Russia's response was not commensurate with the artificial coup in Kiev and the outbreak of the civil war in Ukraine. Russia's response will be proportionate only after the complete transfer of Kiev to Russian control.. US fuсkеd up territorial integrity principle with Kosovo (whose \"independence\" isn't recognized by Ukraine). So I don't think Zelensky believes Biden. Deep concerns and non-binding statements won't persuade him otherwise. Are you really willing to go to war with Russia for this?. In light of this, Ukraine could be threatened with co-operation with arms and the imposition of major economic sanctions on Russia.  The sanctions would have a significant impact on Russia's fragile oil economy.\\nThis is a very good initiative to avoid war situation. Can't Ukraine fight their own war?.Paul Jay\\nI think there’s a lot of people in the American in the military that must be thanking the gods of war that Ukraine is not in NATO right now because the last thing on Earth the Anglos,  they’ve made this clear, is they want some obligation to go send troops into Ukraine..Bitte keine Witze machen.  \\nSanktionen?  - Das einzige, was Putin von einer Invasion in die Ukraine abhalten konnte, war die Aussetzung des Projekts Nord Stream 2. Weder damals noch heute stimmte Deutschland dem zu - Nord Stream 2 - ein stetiger Geldfluss für Putin.  T. Pyne writes “…Russian invasion of Ukraine, it could prove to be the spark that ignites a Third World War, just as the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany started the last world war…” I thought Soviet Union and Germany invaded Poland. poland.Wow! Das könnte der Fahrplan zu Frieden sein! Ein exzellenter Artikel! \\n\\nNegotiate Peace With Russia to Prevent War Over Ukraine      Mistakes of the past? Iraq Yemen Somalia Syria still open war theatres and the ongoing clandestine overthrows attempts in Venezuela Cuba Iran Ukraine..A must read for those interested in the historical context of Russia’s war against Ukraine.\\n\\nThe Gates of Europe: A History of Ukraine : Plokhy, Serhii:  Books     Who is declaring war on anyone? The fuck world do you live in? Outside of Russia beating up Ukraine what fucking nation wants to risk a full on war..PUTIN CONTINUES TO FLOOD TROOPS TO UKRAINE BORDER – ‘SHORT, SHARP WAR WITHIN DAYS’  Yes we all remember when Obama, NATO destroyed ukrainian independence and democracy, set in NATO ; EU marionettes for government and sunk Ukraine in civil war 8 yrs ago!\\n\\nAre ukrainians more stupid than croatians, serbs, iraqians, afghans, sudanese, somalians? \\n\\nReally?  talking nonsense to the Ukrainians again. Russia has never invaded Ukraine and Crimea was always Russian until Kruschev gave it away as a gift. Absolutely no chance the US Administration will risk nuclear war for their Ukrainian puppets. \\n\\n Senators want to designate Russia a “terrorist state” if “forces further invade Ukraine”. Such a designation of a nuclear superpower is unprecedented, an insane move that'd make diplomacy ; negotiation impossible. It’s tantamount to declaring war.'\\n  is going to get us into a war with Russia because he's been bribed by Ukraine.    If war breaks out between Ukraine and Russia, the United States and NATO member states will condemn Russia and impose some sanctions.  Ukraine will be invaded and in a few years they will re-establish relations that will lift the sanctions on Russia.. Going to war against Russia over the Ukraine?.    One of your keyboard buttons is locked....\\nIs Russia really planning a war in Ukraine - or is Washington?\\n So is POTUS stating that the US will engage in war with Russia over Ukraine?.Schiff says Ukraine invasion 'likely' as Biden prepares for call with Zelensky  via \\nBidens an idiot. Almost as bad as schitt. They can go to war. Leave the rest of us out of it. FJB.   U.S. must take responsibility 4 few WAR MONGERS, DIE HARD Pro israeli politicians INTERFERING in INTERNAL affairs of FOREIGN nations.\\nVictoria Nuland, HELPED over throw Ukraine government.Her  conversation of (F*CK EU) was heard ALL over, tryin REPLACE Ukrainian government..    FTR I don’t entirely support Ukraine into NATO but that’s because Article 5 would have to be enforced on Crimea which would lead to a war, but I think ur wrong re:Donbas and think NATO would actually resolve the situation there.. Bidet can tell them anything but that won't cut any mustard. Ukranians just need to look at Afghanistan to figure out how that would work out for them. US just wants another 20 year war ; could give a shit about Ukraine..   A result of civil war—yes as the Columbia journal I sent explains, the kulaks destroyed grain rather than collectivize it and the leader of Ukraine did not deliver all the grain Stalin sent him. Stalin also did not have the power to do all this as he was not a dictator (CIA)..    there.And if that happens,it will seriously cost Ukraine +war may get out of control........  Are u really an idiot or pretending to be one?There is no such  to invade Ukraine issue whatsoever.The issue is that  pushes  to provoke war in Donetsk People's Republic,knowing that Russia may intervene bc 100 of thousands Russian citizens live.Biden’s gonna get us into a war to save his poll numbers…\\n\\nUkraine  I’m guessing there will be a spike in Covid, an MP will so som...   \n",

Biden will not risk a nuclear war over Ukraine and Taiwan. Russia and China know it and they lift a finger when they feel like it . Biden cannot afford another blunder..@AngusEverist @gastweet @StephenKing Ukraine and russia are literally on the brink of war..To simplify: Biden is pushing Ukraine into a war with Russia.\\nInflation is a sure sign of incompetent government.\\nTo confirm his incompetence, war seems logical. \\nComedian is supposed to provoke Russian military response.

They really shouldn't waste their time on little things like this. Embarrassing.@Oenbennach @DAlperovitch @McFaul Indeed. Looking at the map, only Ukraine won't be enough. But it's evident that this factor also helps explain why Russia is supporting an otherwise unloved Lukashenko in Belorussia.

Russia's response will be proportionate only after the complete transfer of Kiev to Russian control..@NatashaBertrand US fuсkеd up territorial integrity principle with Kosovo (whose \"independence\" isn't recognized by Ukraine). So I don't think Zelensky believes Biden. Deep concerns and non-binding statements won't persuade him otherwise. Are you really willing to go to war with Russia for this?.@McFaul In light of this, Ukraine could be threatened with co-operation with arms and the imposition of major economic sanctions on Russia.

Actually, DecentAmericans are fully behind  drawing a red line when it comes to Putin, \\n\\nWe know they they have been waging a stealth war against US (with your super willing help, Treasonweasel) ; a real one against Ukraine\\n\\nWe owe them for standing up to TFG.  They're not going to war over Ukraine.   Hopefully \"We The People\" see through this war spin, the deception, and not hand them our vote. Russian collusion, Ukraine quid pro quo, now Ukraine invasion, on, and on..Never underestimate the stupidity of the human race. With a weak ; demented  a coordinated Russian invasion of Ukraine ; a Chinese invasion of Taiwan can easily happen. War is always a pretext for economic resets. Russia holds more gold than $  That is very telling  explain that Mr. Biden.\\nDraw us a picture.  You tired of not having troops in a war?  There is no stomach in America for anything like a war.  But…. it would be good for business.\\nSorry Ukraine, either way you get trounced.  Putin will not invade Ukraine but to stifle it, creating a tense atmosphere for a considerable long duration. Biden will not risk a nuclear war over Ukraine and Taiwan. Russia and China know it and they lift a finger when they feel like it . Biden cannot afford another blunder..   Ukraine and russia are literally on the brink of war..To simplify: Biden is pushing Ukraine into a war with Russia.\\nInflation is a sure sign of incompetent government.\\nTo confirm his incompetence, war seems logical. \\nComedian is supposed to provoke Russian military response.

It's the problem of the most people who try to understand 'what Putin wants'. In order to understand Putin and his plans you need to start to think as a psychopath.\\nMaybe this'll help\\n European game devs are so hilariously odd.

Responsible for the slaughter of Polish civilians in Volhynia. Ukrainians, worshiping Bandera, spit in the face of Poles, and this is the only one nation that supports a free Ukraine.. Ukraine is one the verge of war. They really shouldn't waste their time on little things like this. Embarrassing.   Indeed. Looking at the map, only Ukraine won't be enough.

That \"civil war\" last since early 2014. But I've no idea how a military conflict between two separate countries can be designated so. Hello from Ukraine and good luck with your shorting..    Russia's response was not commensurate with the artificial coup in Kiev and the outbreak of the civil war in Ukraine. Russia's response will be proportionate only after the complete transfer of Kiev to Russian control.. US fuсkеd up territorial integrity principle with Kosovo (whose \"independence\" isn't recognized by Ukraine). So I don't think Zelensky believes Biden. Deep concerns and non-binding statements won't persuade him otherwise. Are you really willing to go to war with Russia for this?. In light of this, Ukraine could be threatened with co-operation with arms and the imposition of major economic sanctions on Russia.  The sanctions would have a significant impact on Russia's fragile oil economy.\\nThis is a very good initiative to avoid war situation. Can't Ukraine fight their own war?.Paul Jay\\nI think there’s a lot of people in the American in the military that must be thanking the gods of war that Ukraine is not in NATO right now because the last thing on Earth the Anglos,  they’ve made this clear, is they want some obligation to go send troops into Ukraine..Bitte keine Witze machen.  \\nSanktionen?  - Das einzige, was Putin von einer Invasion in die Ukraine abhalten konnte, war die Aussetzung des Projekts Nord Stream 2.

Bidet can tell them anything but that won't cut any mustard. Ukranians just need to look at Afghanistan to figure out how that would work out for them. US just wants another 20 year war ; could give a shit about Ukraine..   A result of civil war—yes as the Columbia journal I sent explains, the kulaks destroyed grain rather than collectivize it and the leader of Ukraine did not deliver all the grain Stalin sent him.

Let’s see how effective they are, North Korea, and Iran have Sanctions and they don’t really seem to care, why should Putin?

That \"civil war\" last since early 2014. But I've no idea how a military conflict between two separate countries can be designated so. Hello from Ukraine and good luck with your shorting..    Russia's response was not commensurate with the artificial coup in Kiev and the outbreak of the civil war in Ukraine. Russia's response will be proportionate only after the complete transfer of Kiev to Russian control.. US fuсkеd up territorial integrity principle with Kosovo (whose \"independence\" isn't recognized by Ukraine). So I don't think Zelensky believes Biden. Deep concerns and non-binding statements won't persuade him otherwise. Are you really willing to go to war with Russia for this?. In light of this, Ukraine could be threatened with co-operation with arms and the imposition of major economic sanctions on Russia.  The sanctions would have a significant impact on Russia's fragile oil economy.\\nThis is a very good initiative to avoid war situation. Can't Ukraine fight their own war?.Paul Jay\\nI think there’s a lot of people in the American in the military that must be thanking the gods of war that Ukraine is not in NATO right now because the last thing on Earth the Anglos,  they’ve made this clear, is they want some obligation to go send troops into Ukraine..Bitte keine Witze machen.  \\nSanktionen?  - Das einzige, was Putin von einer Invasion in die Ukraine abhalten konnte, war die Aussetzung des Projekts Nord Stream 2.

Pyne writes “…Russian invasion of Ukraine, it could prove to be the spark that ignites a Third World War, just as the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany started the last world war…” I thought Soviet Union and Germany invaded Poland. poland.Wow!

Outside of Russia beating up Ukraine what fucking nation wants to risk a full on war..PUTIN CONTINUES TO FLOOD TROOPS TO UKRAINE BORDER – ‘SHORT, SHARP WAR WITHIN DAYS’  Yes we all remember when Obama, NATO destroyed ukrainian independence and democracy, set in NATO ; EU marionettes for government and sunk Ukraine in civil war 8 yrs ago!\\n\\nAre ukrainians more stupid than croatians, serbs, iraqians, afghans, sudanese, somalians? \\n\\nReally?  talking nonsense to the Ukrainians again. Russia has never invaded Ukraine and Crimea was always Russian until Kruschev gave it away as a gift. Absolutely no chance the US Administration will risk nuclear war for their Ukrainian puppets. \\n\\n Senators want to designate Russia a “terrorist state” if “forces further invade Ukraine”. Such a designation of a nuclear superpower is unprecedented, an insane move that'd make diplomacy ; negotiation impossible. It’s tantamount to declaring war.'\\n  is going to get us into a war with Russia because he's been bribed by Ukraine.    If war breaks out between Ukraine and Russia, the United States and NATO member states will condemn Russia and impose some sanctions.  Ukraine will be invaded and in a few years they will re-establish relations that will lift the sanctions on Russia.. Going to war against Russia over the Ukraine?.    One of your keyboard buttons is locked....\\nIs Russia really planning a war in Ukraine - or is Washington?\\n So is POTUS stating that the US will engage in war with Russia over Ukraine?.Schiff says Ukraine invasion 'likely' as Biden prepares for call with Zelensky  via \\nBidens an idiot.

FTR I don’t entirely support Ukraine into NATO but that’s because Article 5 would have to be enforced on Crimea which would lead to a war, but I think ur wrong re:Donbas and think NATO would actually resolve the situation there.. Bidet can tell them anything but that won't cut any mustard. Ukranians just need to look at Afghanistan to figure out how that would work out for them. US just wants another 20 year war ; could give a shit about Ukraine..   A result of civil war—yes as the Columbia journal I sent explains, the kulaks destroyed grain rather than collectivize it and the leader of Ukraine did not deliver all the grain Stalin sent him. Stalin also did not have the power to do all this as he was not a dictator (CIA)..    there.And if that happens,it will seriously cost Ukraine +war may get out of control........  Are u really an idiot or pretending to be one?There is no such  to invade Ukraine issue whatsoever.The issue is that  pushes  to provoke war in Donetsk People's Republic,knowing that Russia may intervene bc 100 of thousands Russian citizens live.Biden’s gonna get us into a war to save his poll numbers…\\n\\nUkraine  I’m guessing there will be a spike in Covid, an MP will so som...</td>\n",

Russian collusion, Ukraine quid pro quo, now Ukraine invasion, on, and on..Never underestimate the stupidity of the human race. With a weak &amp; demented @POTUS a coordinated Russian invasion of Ukraine &amp; a Chinese invasion of Taiwan can easily happen. War is always a pretext for economic resets.

There is no stomach in America for anything like a war.  But…. it would be good for business.\\nSorry Ukraine, either way you get trounced. https://t.co/XJK86AILU9.@ABC Putin will not invade Ukraine but to stifle it, creating a tense atmosphere for a considerable long duration. Biden will not risk a nuclear war over Ukraine and Taiwan. Russia and China know it and they lift a finger when they feel like it . Biden cannot afford another blunder..@AngusEverist @gastweet @StephenKing Ukraine and russia are literally on the brink of war..To simplify: Biden is pushing Ukraine into a war with Russia.\\nInflation is a sure sign of incompetent government.\\nTo confirm his incompetence, war seems logical. \\nComedian is supposed to provoke Russian military response.

They really shouldn't waste their time on little things like this. Embarrassing.@Oenbennach @DAlperovitch @McFaul Indeed. Looking at the map, only Ukraine won't be enough. But it's evident that this factor also helps explain why Russia is supporting an otherwise unloved Lukashenko in Belorussia.

Hello from Ukraine and good luck with your shorting..@ScottMoore0 @DanielCollins85 @bjhbfs @oconnellhugh Russia's response was not commensurate with the artificial coup in Kiev and the outbreak of the civil war in Ukraine. Russia's response will be proportionate only after the complete transfer of Kiev to Russian control..@NatashaBertrand US fuсkеd up territorial integrity principle with Kosovo (whose \"independence\" isn't recognized by Ukraine). So I don't think Zelensky believes Biden. Deep concerns and non-binding statements won't persuade him otherwise. Are you really willing to go to war with Russia for this?.@McFaul In light of this, Ukraine could be threatened with co-operation with arms and the imposition of major economic sanctions on Russia.  The sanctions would have a significant impact on Russia's fragile oil economy.\\nThis is a very good initiative to avoid war situation.@kylegriffin1 Can't Ukraine fight their own war?.Paul Jay\\nI think there’s a lot of people in the American in the military that must be thanking the gods of war that Ukraine is not in NATO right now because the last thing on Earth the Anglos,  they’ve made this clear, is they want some obligation to go send troops into Ukraine..Bitte keine Witze machen.  \\nSanktionen?  - Das einzige, was Putin von einer Invasion in die Ukraine abhalten konnte, war die Aussetzung des Projekts Nord Stream 2.

If you support the Kremlin in its war against Ukraine - you support imperialism and as such British imperialism in Ireland..Biden vows US to act decisively if Russia invades Ukraine \\nWhat's the meaning of Biden's statement the US to act decisively if Russia invade Ukraine? Hopefully Biden isn't going to get us into a nuclear war with Russia because of Ukraine or anyone else other than our own security.   Actually, DecentAmericans are fully behind  drawing a red line when it comes to Putin, \\n\\nWe know they they have been waging a stealth war against US (with your super willing help, Treasonweasel) ; a real one against Ukraine\\n\\nWe owe them for standing up to TFG.  They're not going to war over Ukraine.   Hopefully \"We The People\" see through this war spin, the deception, and not hand them our vote. Russian collusion, Ukraine quid pro quo, now Ukraine invasion, on, and on..Never underestimate the stupidity of the human race. With a weak ; demented  a coordinated Russian invasion of Ukraine ; a Chinese invasion of Taiwan can easily happen. War is always a pretext for economic resets. Russia holds more gold than $  That is very telling  explain that Mr. Biden.\\nDraw us a picture.  You tired of not having troops in a war?  There is no stomach in America for anything like a war.  But…. it would be good for business.\\nSorry Ukraine, either way you get trounced.  Putin will not invade Ukraine but to stifle it, creating a tense atmosphere for a considerable long duration. Biden will not risk a nuclear war over Ukraine and Taiwan. Russia and China know it and they lift a finger when they feel like it . Biden cannot afford another blunder..   Ukraine and russia are literally on the brink of war..To simplify: Biden is pushing Ukraine into a war with Russia.\\nInflation is a sure sign of incompetent government.\\nTo confirm his incompetence, war seems logical. \\nComedian is supposed to provoke Russian military response. Not a joke but hey. \\nAmerican hegemony in full display!  Russia Putin EiropeanUnion China \\nUnitedStates Ukraine \\nIn fact, Russia is afraid of war and is bluffing to achieve its goals through intimidation. However, she may face severe punishment. Moscow and St. Petersburg will be destroyed and China will win over Siberia..  No.\\nLook, you look at the Russo-Ukrainian war as a normal person. It's the problem of the most people who try to understand 'what Putin wants'. In order to understand Putin and his plans you need to start to think as a psychopath.\\nMaybe this'll help\\n European game devs are so hilariously odd. Their studio will be in some depressing soviet era flat near the artic. And every game is like “imagine the Ukraine war… but with alien relics that transform animals into monsters… plus radiation”  Bandera was a murderer and war criminal. Responsible for the slaughter of Polish civilians in Volhynia. Ukrainians, worshiping Bandera, spit in the face of Poles, and this is the only one nation that supports a free Ukraine.. Ukraine is one the verge of war. They really shouldn't waste their time on little things like this. Embarrassing.   Indeed. Looking at the map, only Ukraine won't be enough. But it's evident that this factor also helps explain why Russia is supporting an otherwise unloved Lukashenko in Belorussia. Putin and his Siloviki are stuck in 1980-ies cold war thinking when it comes to national threats..Letters to the Editor: Taiwan and Ukraine are underdogs, but is it wise to fight China and Russia?  via  Most of that 50% isn't in the military and have no plans to join if we do go to war..Thousands march to honor WWII Nazi collaborator Ukraine is not a fledgling democracy just minding its own business. Ukraine is being used by geopolitical forces in the West that answer to the bankrupt speculative financial system to trigger war with Russia   Adam Schiff says it appears to be 'very likely' that Russia will invade Ukraine Sanctions!! Let’s see how effective they are, North Korea, and Iran have Sanctions and they don’t really seem to care, why should Putin?  He thrived in the Cold War!  in America: 1/ Putin Ukraine threats 2/ Political Covid_19 plan 4 herd immunity \"lite\" 3/ No mandates bec 1/2 the US is anti science for economic reason 4/ Ignoring omicron impact on kids &lt;5 (horrific BTW) 5/ Jan6 redux possible 6/ talk of civil war 7/ TFG ; team r free. That \"civil war\" last since early 2014. But I've no idea how a military conflict between two separate countries can be designated so. Hello from Ukraine and good luck with your shorting..    Russia's response was not commensurate with the artificial coup in Kiev and the outbreak of the civil war in Ukraine. Russia's response will be proportionate only after the complete transfer of Kiev to Russian control.. US fuсkеd up territorial integrity principle with Kosovo (whose \"independence\" isn't recognized by Ukraine). So I don't think Zelensky believes Biden. Deep concerns and non-binding statements won't persuade him otherwise. Are you really willing to go to war with Russia for this?. In light of this, Ukraine could be threatened with co-operation with arms and the imposition of major economic sanctions on Russia.  The sanctions would have a significant impact on Russia's fragile oil economy.\\nThis is a very good initiative to avoid war situation. Can't Ukraine fight their own war?.Paul Jay\\nI think there’s a lot of people in the American in the military that must be thanking the gods of war that Ukraine is not in NATO right now because the last thing on Earth the Anglos,  they’ve made this clear, is they want some obligation to go send troops into Ukraine..Bitte keine Witze machen.  \\nSanktionen?  - Das einzige, was Putin von einer Invasion in die Ukraine abhalten konnte, war die Aussetzung des Projekts Nord Stream 2. Weder damals noch heute stimmte Deutschland dem zu - Nord Stream 2 - ein stetiger Geldfluss für Putin.  T. Pyne writes “…Russian invasion of Ukraine, it could prove to be the spark that ignites a Third World War, just as the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany started the last world war…” I thought Soviet Union and Germany invaded Poland. poland.Wow!

The fuck world do you live in? Outside of Russia beating up Ukraine what fucking nation wants to risk a full on war..PUTIN CONTINUES TO FLOOD TROOPS TO UKRAINE BORDER – ‘SHORT, SHARP WAR WITHIN DAYS’  Yes we all remember when Obama, NATO destroyed ukrainian independence and democracy, set in NATO ; EU marionettes for government and sunk Ukraine in civil war 8 yrs ago!\\n\\nAre ukrainians more stupid than croatians, serbs, iraqians, afghans, sudanese, somalians? \\n\\nReally?  talking nonsense to the Ukrainians again. Russia has never invaded Ukraine and Crimea was always Russian until Kruschev gave it away as a gift. Absolutely no chance the US Administration will risk nuclear war for their Ukrainian puppets. \\n\\n Senators want to designate Russia a “terrorist state” if “forces further invade Ukraine”. Such a designation of a nuclear superpower is unprecedented, an insane move that'd make diplomacy ; negotiation impossible. It’s tantamount to declaring war.'\\n  is going to get us into a war with Russia because he's been bribed by Ukraine.    If war breaks out between Ukraine and Russia, the United States and NATO member states will condemn Russia and impose some sanctions.  Ukraine will be invaded and in a few years they will re-establish relations that will lift the sanctions on Russia.. Going to war against Russia over the Ukraine?.    One of your keyboard buttons is locked....\\nIs Russia really planning a war in Ukraine - or is Washington?\\n So is POTUS stating that the US will engage in war with Russia over Ukraine?.Schiff says Ukraine invasion 'likely' as Biden prepares for call with Zelensky  via \\nBidens an idiot. Almost as bad as schitt. They can go to war. Leave the rest of us out of it. FJB.   U.S. must take responsibility 4 few WAR MONGERS, DIE HARD Pro israeli politicians INTERFERING in INTERNAL affairs of FOREIGN nations.\\nVictoria Nuland, HELPED over throw Ukraine government.Her  conversation of (F*CK EU) was heard ALL over, tryin REPLACE Ukrainian government..    FTR I don’t entirely support Ukraine into NATO but that’s because Article 5 would have to be enforced on Crimea which would lead to a war, but I think ur wrong re:Donbas and think NATO would actually resolve the situation there.. Bidet can tell them anything but that won't cut any mustard. Ukranians just need to look at Afghanistan to figure out how that would work out for them. US just wants another 20 year war ; could give a shit about Ukraine..

They really shouldn't waste their time on little things like this. Embarrassing.@Oenbennach @DAlperovitch @McFaul Indeed. Looking at the map, only Ukraine won't be enough. But it's evident that this factor also helps explain why Russia is supporting an otherwise unloved Lukashenko in Belorussia.

Bidet can tell them anything but that won't cut any mustard. Ukranians just need to look at Afghanistan to figure out how that would work out for them. US just wants another 20 year war ; could give a shit about Ukraine..

              "      <td>Hilarious, Kremlin propaganda bullshit. I could start tweeting photos of Russian Nazi lovers, what’s the point “the fools, the fools, the fools”. If you support the Kremlin in its war against Ukraine - you support imperialism and as such British imperialism in Ireland..Biden vows US to act decisively if Russia invades Ukraine \\nWhat's the meaning of Biden's statement the US to act decisively if Russia invade Ukraine? Hopefully Biden isn't going to get us into a nuclear war with Russia because of Ukraine or anyone else other than our own security.   Actually, DecentAmericans are fully behind  drawing a red line when it comes to Putin, \\n\\nWe know they they have been waging a stealth war against US (with your super willing help, Treasonweasel) ; a real one against Ukraine\\n\\nWe owe them for standing up to TFG.  They're not going to war over Ukraine.   Hopefully \"We The People\" see through this war spin, the deception, and not hand them our vote. Russian collusion, Ukraine quid pro quo, now Ukraine invasion, on, and on..Never underestimate the stupidity of the human race. With a weak ; demented  a coordinated Russian invasion of Ukraine ; a Chinese invasion of Taiwan can easily happen. War is always a pretext for economic resets. Russia holds more gold than $  That is very telling  explain that Mr. Biden.\\nDraw us a picture.  You tired of not having troops in a war?  There is no stomach in America for anything like a war.  But…. it would be good for business.\\nSorry Ukraine, either way you get trounced.  Putin will not invade Ukraine but to stifle it, creating a tense atmosphere for a considerable long duration. Biden will not risk a nuclear war over Ukraine and Taiwan. Russia and China know it and they lift a finger when they feel like it . Biden cannot afford another blunder..   Ukraine and russia are literally on the brink of war..To simplify: Biden is pushing Ukraine into a war with Russia.\\nInflation is a sure sign of incompetent government.\\nTo confirm his incompetence, war seems logical. \\nComedian is supposed to provoke Russian military response. Not a joke but hey. \\nAmerican hegemony in full display!  Russia Putin EiropeanUnion China \\nUnitedStates Ukraine \\nIn fact, Russia is afraid of war and is bluffing to achieve its goals through intimidation. However, she may face severe punishment. Moscow and St. Petersburg will be destroyed and China will win over Siberia..  No.\\nLook, you look at the Russo-Ukrainian war as a normal person. It's the problem of the most people who try to understand 'what Putin wants'. In order to understand Putin and his plans you need to start to think as a psychopath.\\nMaybe this'll help\\n European game devs are so hilariously odd. Their studio will be in some depressing soviet era flat near the artic. And every game is like “imagine the Ukraine war… but with alien relics that transform animals into monsters… plus radiation”  Bandera was a murderer and war criminal. Responsible for the slaughter of Polish civilians in Volhynia. Ukrainians, worshiping Bandera, spit in the face of Poles, and this is the only one nation that supports a free Ukraine.. Ukraine is one the verge of war. They really shouldn't waste their time on little things like this. Embarrassing.   Indeed. Looking at the map, only Ukraine won't be enough. But it's evident that this factor also helps explain why Russia is supporting an otherwise unloved Lukashenko in Belorussia. Putin and his Siloviki are stuck in 1980-ies cold war thinking when it comes to national threats..Letters to the Editor: Taiwan and Ukraine are underdogs, but is it wise to fight China and Russia?  via  Most of that 50% isn't in the military and have no plans to join if we do go to war..Thousands march to honor WWII Nazi collaborator Ukraine is not a fledgling democracy just minding its own business. Ukraine is being used by geopolitical forces in the West that answer to the bankrupt speculative financial system to trigger war with Russia   Adam Schiff says it appears to be 'very likely' that Russia will invade Ukraine Sanctions!! Let’s see how effective they are, North Korea, and Iran have Sanctions and they don’t really seem to care, why should Putin?  He thrived in the Cold War!  in America: 1/ Putin Ukraine threats 2/ Political Covid_19 plan 4 herd immunity \"lite\" 3/ No mandates bec 1/2 the US is anti science for economic reason 4/ Ignoring omicron impact on kids &amp;lt;5 (horrific BTW) 5/ Jan6 redux possible 6/ talk of civil war 7/ TFG ; team r free. That \"civil war\" last since early 2014. But I've no idea how a military conflict between two separate countries can be designated so. Hello from Ukraine and good luck with your shorting..    Russia's response was not commensurate with the artificial coup in Kiev and the outbreak of the civil war in Ukraine. Russia's response will be proportionate only after the complete transfer of Kiev to Russian control.. US fuсkеd up territorial integrity principle with Kosovo (whose \"independence\" isn't recognized by Ukraine). So I don't think Zelensky believes Biden. Deep concerns and non-binding statements won't persuade him otherwise. Are you really willing to go to war with Russia for this?. In light of this, Ukraine could be threatened with co-operation with arms and the imposition of major economic sanctions on Russia.  The sanctions would have a significant impact on Russia's fragile oil economy.\\nThis is a very good initiative to avoid war situation. Can't Ukraine fight their own war?.Paul Jay\\nI think there’s a lot of people in the American in the military that must be thanking the gods of war that Ukraine is not in NATO right now because the last thing on Earth the Anglos,  they’ve made this clear, is they want some obligation to go send troops into Ukraine..Bitte keine Witze machen.  \\nSanktionen?  - Das einzige, was Putin von einer Invasion in die Ukraine abhalten konnte, war die Aussetzung des Projekts Nord Stream 2. Weder damals noch heute stimmte Deutschland dem zu - Nord Stream 2 - ein stetiger Geldfluss für Putin.  T. Pyne writes “…Russian invasion of Ukraine, it could prove to be the spark that ignites a Third World War, just as the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany started the last world war…” I thought Soviet Union and Germany invaded Poland. poland.Wow!

Bidet can tell them anything but that won't cut any mustard. Ukranians just need to look at Afghanistan to figure out how that would work out for them. US just wants another 20 year war ; could give a shit about Ukraine..

Biden will not risk a nuclear war over Ukraine and Taiwan. Russia and China know it and they lift a finger when they feel like it . Biden cannot afford another blunder..@AngusEverist @gastweet @StephenKing Ukraine and russia are literally on the brink of war..To simplify: Biden is pushing Ukraine into a war with Russia.\\nInflation is a sure sign of incompetent government.\\nTo confirm his incompetence, war seems logical. \\nComedian is supposed to provoke Russian military response.

They really shouldn't waste their time on little things like this. Embarrassing.@Oenbennach @DAlperovitch @McFaul Indeed. Looking at the map, only Ukraine won't be enough. But it's evident that this factor also helps explain why Russia is supporting an otherwise unloved Lukashenko in Belorussia.

Hello from Ukraine and good luck with your shorting..@ScottMoore0 @DanielCollins85 @bjhbfs @oconnellhugh Russia's response was not commensurate with the artificial coup in Kiev and the outbreak of the civil war in Ukraine. Russia's response will be proportionate only after the complete transfer of Kiev to Russian control..@NatashaBertrand US fuсkеd up territorial integrity principle with Kosovo (whose \"independence\" isn't recognized by Ukraine). So I don't think Zelensky believes Biden. Deep concerns and non-binding statements won't persuade him otherwise. Are you really willing to go to war with Russia for this?.@McFaul In light of this, Ukraine could be threatened with co-operation with arms and the imposition of major economic sanctions on Russia.  The sanctions would have a significant impact on Russia's fragile oil economy.\\nThis is a very good initiative to avoid war situation.@kylegriffin1 Can't Ukraine fight their own war?.Paul Jay\\nI think there’s a lot of people in the American in the military that must be thanking the gods of war that Ukraine is not in NATO right now because the last thing on Earth the Anglos,  they’ve made this clear, is they want some obligation to go send troops into Ukraine..Bitte keine Witze machen.  \\nSanktionen?  - Das einzige, was Putin von einer Invasion in die Ukraine abhalten konnte, war die Aussetzung des Projekts Nord Stream 2.

              "2    Hilarious, Kremlin propaganda bullshit. I could start tweeting photos of Russian Nazi lovers, what’s the point “the fools, the fools, the fools”. If you support the Kremlin in its war against Ukraine - you support imperialism and as such British imperialism in Ireland..Biden vows US to act decisively if Russia invades Ukraine \\nWhat's the meaning of Biden's statement the US to act decisively if Russia invade Ukraine? Hopefully Biden isn't going to get us into a nuclear war with Russia because of Ukraine or anyone else other than our own security.   Actually, DecentAmericans are fully behind  drawing a red line when it comes to Putin, \\n\\nWe know they they have been waging a stealth war against US (with your super willing help, Treasonweasel) ; a real one against Ukraine\\n\\nWe owe them for standing up to TFG.  They're not going to war over Ukraine.   Hopefully \"We The People\" see through this war spin, the deception, and not hand them our vote. Russian collusion, Ukraine quid pro quo, now Ukraine invasion, on, and on..Never underestimate the stupidity of the human race. With a weak ; demented  a coordinated Russian invasion of Ukraine ; a Chinese invasion of Taiwan can easily happen. War is always a pretext for economic resets. Russia holds more gold than $  That is very telling  explain that Mr. Biden.\\nDraw us a picture.  You tired of not having troops in a war?  There is no stomach in America for anything like a war.  But…. it would be good for business.\\nSorry Ukraine, either way you get trounced.  Putin will not invade Ukraine but to stifle it, creating a tense atmosphere for a considerable long duration. Biden will not risk a nuclear war over Ukraine and Taiwan. Russia and China know it and they lift a finger when they feel like it . Biden cannot afford another blunder..

Iraq Yemen Somalia Syria still open war theatres and the ongoing clandestine overthrows attempts in Venezuela Cuba Iran Ukraine..A must read for those interested in the historical context of Russia’s war against Ukraine.\\n\\nThe Gates of Europe: A History of Ukraine : Plokhy, Serhii:  Books     Who is declaring war on anyone? The fuck world do you live in? Outside of Russia beating up Ukraine what fucking nation wants to risk a full on war..PUTIN CONTINUES TO FLOOD TROOPS TO UKRAINE BORDER – ‘SHORT, SHARP WAR WITHIN DAYS’  Yes we all remember when Obama, NATO destroyed ukrainian independence and democracy, set in NATO ; EU marionettes for government and sunk Ukraine in civil war 8 yrs ago!\\n\\nAre ukrainians more stupid than croatians, serbs, iraqians, afghans, sudanese, somalians? \\n\\nReally?  talking nonsense to the Ukrainians again. Russia has never invaded Ukraine and Crimea was always Russian until Kruschev gave it away as a gift. Absolutely no chance the US Administration will risk nuclear war for their Ukrainian puppets. \\n\\n Senators want to designate Russia a “terrorist state” if “forces further invade Ukraine”. Such a designation of a nuclear superpower is unprecedented, an insane move that'd make diplomacy ; negotiation impossible. It’s tantamount to declaring war.'\\n  is going to get us into a war with Russia because he's been bribed by Ukraine.    If war breaks out between Ukraine and Russia, the United States and NATO member states will condemn Russia and impose some sanctions.  Ukraine will be invaded and in a few years they will re-establish relations that will lift the sanctions on Russia.. Going to war against Russia over the Ukraine?.    One of your keyboard buttons is locked....\\nIs Russia really planning a war in Ukraine - or is Washington?\\n So is POTUS stating that the US will engage in war with Russia over Ukraine?.Schiff says Ukraine invasion 'likely' as Biden prepares for call with Zelensky  via \\nBidens an idiot.

FTR I don’t entirely support Ukraine into NATO but that’s because Article 5 would have to be enforced on Crimea which would lead to a war, but I think ur wrong re:Donbas and think NATO would actually resolve the situation there.. Bidet can tell them anything but that won't cut any mustard. Ukranians just need to look at Afghanistan to figure out how that would work out for them. US just wants another 20 year war ; could give a shit about Ukraine..   A result of civil war—yes as the Columbia journal I sent explains, the kulaks destroyed grain rather than collectivize it and the leader of Ukraine did not deliver all the grain Stalin sent him. Stalin also did not have the power to do all this as he was not a dictator (CIA)..    there.And if that happens,it will seriously cost Ukraine +war may get out of control........  Are u really an idiot or pretending to be one?There is no such  to invade Ukraine issue whatsoever.The issue is that  pushes  to provoke war in Donetsk People's Republic,knowing that Russia may intervene bc 100 of thousands Russian citizens live.Biden’s gonna get us into a war to save his poll numbers…\\n\\nUkraine  I’m guessing there will be a spike in Covid, an MP will so som...</td>\n",

              "2  @McinerneyDerek @wallacemick Hilarious, Kremlin propaganda bullshit. I could start tweeting photos of Russian Nazi lovers, what’s the point “the fools, the fools, the fools”. If you support the Kremlin in its war against Ukraine - you support imperialism and as such British imperialism in Ireland..Biden vows US to act decisively if Russia invades Ukraine \\nWhat's the meaning of Biden's statement the US to act decisively if Russia invade Ukraine? Hopefully Biden isn't going to get us into a nuclear war with Russia because of Ukraine or anyone else other than our own security.@RepLeeZeldin @LizMacDonaldFOX @FoxBusiness Actually, #DecentAmericans are fully behind @POTUS drawing a red line when it comes to Putin, @leezeldin\\n\\nWe know they they have been waging a stealth war against US (with your super willing help, #Treasonweasel) &amp; a real one against Ukraine\\n\\nWe owe them for standing up to TFG.@lsutigerzfan @AP They're not going to war over Ukraine.@FaceTheNation @margbrennan @RepAdamSchiff Hopefully \"We The People\" see through this war spin, the deception, and not hand them our vote. Russian collusion, Ukraine quid pro quo, now Ukraine invasion, on, and on..Never underestimate the stupidity of the human race. With a weak &amp; demented @POTUS a coordinated Russian invasion of Ukraine &amp; a Chinese invasion of Taiwan can easily happen. War is always a pretext for economic resets.

Biden will not risk a nuclear war over Ukraine and Taiwan. Russia and China know it and they lift a finger when they feel like it .

They really shouldn't waste their time on little things like this. Embarrassing.@Oenbennach @DAlperovitch @McFaul Indeed. Looking at the map, only Ukraine won't be enough. But it's evident that this factor also helps explain why Russia is supporting an otherwise unloved Lukashenko in Belorussia.

Hello from Ukraine and good luck with your shorting..@ScottMoore0 @DanielCollins85 @bjhbfs @oconnellhugh Russia's response was not commensurate with the artificial coup in Kiev and the outbreak of the civil war in Ukraine. Russia's response will be proportionate only after the complete transfer of Kiev to Russian control..@NatashaBertrand US fuсkеd up territorial integrity principle with Kosovo (whose \"independence\" isn't recognized by Ukraine). So I don't think Zelensky believes Biden. Deep concerns and non-binding statements won't persuade him otherwise. Are you really willing to go to war with Russia for this?.@McFaul In light of this, Ukraine could be threatened with co-operation with arms and the imposition of major economic sanctions on Russia.

              "2    Hilarious, Kremlin propaganda bullshit. I could start tweeting photos of Russian Nazi lovers, what’s the point “the fools, the fools, the fools”. If you support the Kremlin in its war against Ukraine - you support imperialism and as such British imperialism in Ireland..Biden vows US to act decisively if Russia invades Ukraine \\nWhat's the meaning of Biden's statement the US to act decisively if Russia invade Ukraine? Hopefully Biden isn't going to get us into a nuclear war with Russia because of Ukraine or anyone else other than our own security.   Actually, DecentAmericans are fully behind  drawing a red line when it comes to Putin, \\n\\nWe know they they have been waging a stealth war against US (with your super willing help, Treasonweasel) ; a real one against Ukraine\\n\\nWe owe them for standing up to TFG.  They're not going to war over Ukraine.   Hopefully \"We The People\" see through this war spin, the deception, and not hand them our vote. Russian collusion, Ukraine quid pro quo, now Ukraine invasion, on, and on..Never underestimate the stupidity of the human race. With a weak ; demented  a coordinated Russian invasion of Ukraine ; a Chinese invasion of Taiwan can easily happen. War is always a pretext for economic resets. Russia holds more gold than $  That is very telling  explain that Mr. Biden.\\nDraw us a picture.  You tired of not having troops in a war?  There is no stomach in America for anything like a war.  But…. it would be good for business.\\nSorry Ukraine, either way you get trounced.  Putin will not invade Ukraine but to stifle it, creating a tense atmosphere for a considerable long duration. Biden will not risk a nuclear war over Ukraine and Taiwan. Russia and China know it and they lift a finger when they feel like it . Biden cannot afford another blunder..   Ukraine and russia are literally on the brink of war..To simplify: Biden is pushing Ukraine into a war with Russia.\\nInflation is a sure sign of incompetent government.\\nTo confirm his incompetence, war seems logical. \\nComedian is supposed to provoke Russian military response. Not a joke but hey. \\nAmerican hegemony in full display!  Russia Putin EiropeanUnion China \\nUnitedStates Ukraine \\nIn fact, Russia is afraid of war and is bluffing to achieve its goals through intimidation. However, she may face severe punishment. Moscow and St. Petersburg will be destroyed and China will win over Siberia..  No.\\nLook, you look at the Russo-Ukrainian war as a normal person. It's the problem of the most people who try to understand 'what Putin wants'. In order to understand Putin and his plans you need to start to think as a psychopath.\\nMaybe this'll help\\n European game devs are so hilariously odd. Their studio will be in some depressing soviet era flat near the artic. And every game is like “imagine the Ukraine war… but with alien relics that transform animals into monsters… plus radiation”  Bandera was a murderer and war criminal. Responsible for the slaughter of Polish civilians in Volhynia. Ukrainians, worshiping Bandera, spit in the face of Poles, and this is the only one nation that supports a free Ukraine.. Ukraine is one the verge of war. They really shouldn't waste their time on little things like this. Embarrassing.   Indeed. Looking at the map, only Ukraine won't be enough. But it's evident that this factor also helps explain why Russia is supporting an otherwise unloved Lukashenko in Belorussia. Putin and his Siloviki are stuck in 1980-ies cold war thinking when it comes to national threats..Letters to the Editor: Taiwan and Ukraine are underdogs, but is it wise to fight China and Russia?  via  Most of that 50% isn't in the military and have no plans to join if we do go to war..Thousands march to honor WWII Nazi collaborator Ukraine is not a fledgling democracy just minding its own business. Ukraine is being used by geopolitical forces in the West that answer to the bankrupt speculative financial system to trigger war with Russia   Adam Schiff says it appears to be 'very likely' that Russia will invade Ukraine Sanctions!! Let’s see how effective they are, North Korea, and Iran have Sanctions and they don’t really seem to care, why should Putin?  He thrived in the Cold War!  in America: 1/ Putin Ukraine threats 2/ Political Covid_19 plan 4 herd immunity \"lite\" 3/ No mandates bec 1/2 the US is anti science for economic reason 4/ Ignoring omicron impact on kids &lt;5 (horrific BTW) 5/ Jan6 redux possible 6/ talk of civil war 7/ TFG ; team r free. That \"civil war\" last since early 2014. But I've no idea how a military conflict between two separate countries can be designated so. Hello from Ukraine and good luck with your shorting..    Russia's response was not commensurate with the artificial coup in Kiev and the outbreak of the civil war in Ukraine. Russia's response will be proportionate only after the complete transfer of Kiev to Russian control.. US fuсkеd up territorial integrity principle with Kosovo (whose \"independence\" isn't recognized by Ukraine). So I don't think Zelensky believes Biden. Deep concerns and non-binding statements won't persuade him otherwise. Are you really willing to go to war with Russia for this?. In light of this, Ukraine could be threatened with co-operation with arms and the imposition of major economic sanctions on Russia.  The sanctions would have a significant impact on Russia's fragile oil economy.\\nThis is a very good initiative to avoid war situation. Can't Ukraine fight their own war?.Paul Jay\\nI think there’s a lot of people in the American in the military that must be thanking the gods of war that Ukraine is not in NATO right now because the last thing on Earth the Anglos,  they’ve made this clear, is they want some obligation to go send troops into Ukraine..Bitte keine Witze machen.  \\nSanktionen?  - Das einzige, was Putin von einer Invasion in die Ukraine abhalten konnte, war die Aussetzung des Projekts Nord Stream 2. Weder damals noch heute stimmte Deutschland dem zu - Nord Stream 2 - ein stetiger Geldfluss für Putin.  T. Pyne writes “…Russian invasion of Ukraine, it could prove to be the spark that ignites a Third World War, just as the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany started the last world war…” I thought Soviet Union and Germany invaded Poland. poland.Wow! Das könnte der Fahrplan zu Frieden sein! Ein exzellenter Artikel! \\n\\nNegotiate Peace With Russia to Prevent War Over Ukraine      Mistakes of the past? Iraq Yemen Somalia Syria still open war theatres and the ongoing clandestine overthrows attempts in Venezuela Cuba Iran Ukraine..A must read for those interested in the historical context of Russia’s war against Ukraine.\\n\\nThe Gates of Europe: A History of Ukraine : Plokhy, Serhii:  Books     Who is declaring war on anyone? The fuck world do you live in? Outside of Russia beating up Ukraine what fucking nation wants to risk a full on war..PUTIN CONTINUES TO FLOOD TROOPS TO UKRAINE BORDER – ‘SHORT, SHARP WAR WITHIN DAYS’  Yes we all remember when Obama, NATO destroyed ukrainian independence and democracy, set in NATO ; EU marionettes for government and sunk Ukraine in civil war 8 yrs ago!\\n\\nAre ukrainians more stupid than croatians, serbs, iraqians, afghans, sudanese, somalians? \\n\\nReally?  talking nonsense to the Ukrainians again. Russia has never invaded Ukraine and Crimea was always Russian until Kruschev gave it away as a gift. Absolutely no chance the US Administration will risk nuclear war for their Ukrainian puppets. \\n\\n Senators want to designate Russia a “terrorist state” if “forces further invade Ukraine”. Such a designation of a nuclear superpower is unprecedented, an insane move that'd make diplomacy ; negotiation impossible. It’s tantamount to declaring war.'\\n  is going to get us into a war with Russia because he's been bribed by Ukraine.    If war breaks out between Ukraine and Russia, the United States and NATO member states will condemn Russia and impose some sanctions.  Ukraine will be invaded and in a few years they will re-establish relations that will lift the sanctions on Russia.. Going to war against Russia over the Ukraine?.    One of your keyboard buttons is locked....\\nIs Russia really planning a war in Ukraine - or is Washington?\\n So is POTUS stating that the US will engage in war with Russia over Ukraine?.Schiff says Ukraine invasion 'likely' as Biden prepares for call with Zelensky  via \\nBidens an idiot. Almost as bad as schitt. They can go to war. Leave the rest of us out of it. FJB.   U.S. must take responsibility 4 few WAR MONGERS, DIE HARD Pro israeli politicians INTERFERING in INTERNAL affairs of FOREIGN nations.\\nVictoria Nuland, HELPED over throw Ukraine government.Her  conversation of (F*CK EU) was heard ALL over, tryin REPLACE Ukrainian government..    FTR I don’t entirely support Ukraine into NATO but that’s because Article 5 would have to be enforced on Crimea which would lead to a war, but I think ur wrong re:Donbas and think NATO would actually resolve the situation there.. Bidet can tell them anything but that won't cut any mustard. Ukranians just need to look at Afghanistan to figure out how that would work out for them. US just wants another 20 year war ; could give a shit about Ukraine..   A result of civil war—yes as the Columbia journal I sent explains, the kulaks destroyed grain rather than collectivize it and the leader of Ukraine did not deliver all the grain Stalin sent him. Stalin also did not have the power to do all this as he was not a dictator (CIA)..    there.And if that happens,it will seriously cost Ukraine +war may get out of control........
